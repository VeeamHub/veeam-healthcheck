JssNote5 = •	Make sure that your backup job or replication job is selecting the correct proxies by viewing the job session statistics in the VBR Console.
JssNote6 = •	Investigate backup job performance. If specific jobs are taking longer to process than normal, check for warnings, compare the bottleneck statistics to previous jobs sessions, and try to isolate the problem to a specific proxy, repository, host, or datastore.
