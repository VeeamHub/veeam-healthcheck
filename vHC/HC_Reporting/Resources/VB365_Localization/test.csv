"JssNote1 "," •	Scheduling jobs to start at different time slots will help to distribute resources and prevent the bottleneck that is a job waiting on available resources. (Ex. Instead of scheduling your jobs to all start at 8:00PM, start one job at 8:00, another at 8:30, and another at 9:00.)"
"JssNote2 "," •	If resources allow, increase the number of concurrent tasks allowed on your proxies.<a href"
"JssNote3 "," o	If your backup proxy does not have adequate resources to increase tasks, and it is a virtual machine, you should consider increasing the amount of CPU and RAM available to the proxy."
"JssNote4 "," o	If adding resources to existing proxies is not an options, consider deploying additional backup proxies from within “Backup Infrastructure->Backup Proxies”"
"JssNote5 "," •	Make sure that your backup job or replication job is selecting the correct proxies by viewing the job session statistics in the VBR Console."
"JssNote6 "," •	Investigate backup job performance. If specific jobs are taking longer to process than normal, check for warnings, compare the bottleneck statistics to previous jobs sessions, and try to isolate the problem to a specific proxy, repository, host, or datastore."
"JssNote7 "," o	Move larger VMs / servers to their own job and schedule to ensure conflict does not occur with faster completing job's backup window (schedule these jobs before all other jobs or after all other jobs, for example)"
