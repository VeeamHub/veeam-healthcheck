v1.0

Requirements:

Summary:
VeeamHealthCheck is a lightweight tool using native B&R PowerShell integration to 
gather and analyze information about the install, configuration, and environment. This is done using a mix of
SQL queries, PowerShell Scripts, and parsing of Veeam logging.

Usage:
- Run the VeeamHealthCheck.exe via elevated CMD/PS or by right-click -> 'Run as Administrator'.
- The GUI will show, containing similar instructions to these.
- Here are the presented options:
	- Collect Session Data: This is a default and a must for a comprehensive health check. Disabling this will greatly speed up the process but will leave the report with minimal details.
	- Remove sensitive data types from report: this option will remove sensitive data types as found in https://www.veeam.com/kb2462. The tool will leave behind a legend in C:\Temp that the user can use to decipher which items are being referred.
	- Accept Terms: This is required before the RUN option is available. Basically, this is where the user agrees to run the tool at their own risk.
	- Import: this option is mostly for internal use. This generates a report based on whatever CSV files are in C:\temp\vHC. Be that they are imported, modified, etc.
	- Run: This is the main execution. This will pop up 2 PowerShell windows that need to run to completion. After a few hours, when they complete, the final report will be automatically opened.
- Output is stored in C:\temp\vHC
	- VeeamHealthCheckReport... HTML file: the main report.
	- ~14 CSV Files
